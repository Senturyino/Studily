    student_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    class_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,

    pdf_path VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    upload_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables in config.env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=studily
PORT=3000

# Start the server
node backend/server.js
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
- Open `frontend/SchoolAdmin/upload-results/upload-results.html` for admin upload
- Open `frontend/Student Dashboard UI/results/results.html` for student results

## Usage Guide

### For Administrators

1. **Prepare PDF Files**
   - Name each PDF with the student ID (e.g., `STU001.pdf`, `STU002.pdf`)
   - Place all PDFs in a single folder

2. **Upload Results**
   - Navigate to the upload results page
   - Select the appropriate class and semester
   - Choose the folder containing PDF files
   - Click "Upload Results"

3. **Monitor Upload**
   - View real-time upload progress
   - Check upload summary for success/failure status
   - Verify all students have results uploaded

### For Students

1. **Access Results**
   - Log into student dashboard
   - Navigate to "Results" section
   - View all available results

2. **View Results**
   - Click "View" to open PDF in browser
   - Use browser controls to zoom, scroll, or print

3. **Download Results**
   - Click "Download" to save PDF locally
   - Use "Download All" to get all results at once

## File Naming Convention

PDF files must be named exactly with the student ID:
- ✅ `STU001.pdf`
- ✅ `STU002.pdf`
- ❌ `STU001_result.pdf`
- ❌ `student_001.pdf`

## Security Considerations

- Only PDF files are accepted for upload
- File size limits are enforced
- Student validation ensures only valid students receive results
- PDF files are stored securely on the server
- Access is controlled through student authentication

## Error Handling

### Common Upload Errors
- **Invalid File Type**: Only PDF files are accepted
- **Student Not Found**: PDF filename doesn't match any student ID
- **Duplicate Results**: System handles updates for existing results
- **File Size Limit**: Large files are rejected

### Student View Errors
- **No Results Found**: Student has no uploaded results
- **File Not Found**: PDF file was deleted or corrupted
- **Network Error**: Connection issues when loading results

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Issues
1. **Files not uploading**: Check file size and type
2. **Student validation fails**: Verify student IDs exist in database
3. **Progress not showing**: Check browser console for errors

### Viewing Issues
1. **PDFs not loading**: Verify server is running and files exist
2. **Empty results page**: Check if results were uploaded for the student
3. **Download fails**: Check file permissions and server configuration

## Future Enhancements

- **Bulk Download**: ZIP file creation for multiple results
- **Email Notifications**: Notify students when results are uploaded
- **Grade Analytics**: Automatic grade calculation and trends
- **Parent Access**: Separate parent portal for viewing results
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile application for results viewing
- **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated search and filter options
