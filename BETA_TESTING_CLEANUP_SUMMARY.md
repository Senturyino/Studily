## What This Means for Beta Testing

### Database Setup:
- The database schema is now clean with no sample data
- You'll need to manually add:
  - Academic years
  - Classes
  - Subjects
  - Teachers
  - Students
  - Main admin account

### Frontend Behavior:
- All data containers are now empty
- TODO comments indicate where API calls should be implemented
- The system will show empty states until real data is added

### Next Steps for Beta Testing:
1. Set up the database using the clean schema
2. Add a main admin account using the template
3. Add real academic years, classes, and subjects
4. Add real teachers and students
5. Test all functionality with real data

## Files to Keep for Reference:
- `backend/database_schema_with_sample_data.sql` - Contains original sample data
- `backend/add_main_admin_with_sample_data.sql` - Contains original admin setup

## Notes:
- All sample data has been replaced with TODO comments indicating where real API calls should be implemented
- The system is now ready for beta testing with real data
- No functionality has been removed, only sample data has been cleared
