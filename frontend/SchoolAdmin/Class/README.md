## API Integration

The system is designed to integrate with backend APIs. Replace the simulated API calls in `manage-classes.js` with actual API endpoints:

### Required API Endpoints

1. **GET /api/classes** - Fetch all classes
2. **POST /api/classes** - Create new class
3. **PUT /api/classes/:id** - Update class
4. **DELETE /api/classes/:id** - Delete class
5. **GET /api/subjects** - Fetch all subjects
6. **GET /api/academic-years** - Fetch academic years
7. **POST /api/classes/promote** - Promote classes

## Styling and Theme

The system uses the unified Studily theme with:
- **Primary Colors**: Purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Modern UI**: Glassmorphism effects and smooth animations
- **Accessibility**: High contrast and keyboard navigation

## Browser Support

- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

## Performance Features

- **Debounced Search**: Optimized search with 300ms delay
- **Pagination**: Efficient handling of large datasets
- **Lazy Loading**: Progressive loading of data
- **Caching**: Local storage of frequently accessed data

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **XSS Prevention**: Proper escaping of user data
- **CSRF Protection**: Form tokens for state-changing operations
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control (to be implemented)

## Future Enhancements

- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple classes for batch operations
- **Import/Export**: CSV import and export functionality
- **Advanced Analytics**: Class performance metrics and reports
- **Integration**: Connect with student and teacher management systems
- **Notifications**: Real-time updates and alerts
- **Audit Trail**: Track all changes and modifications

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Modal Not Opening**: Check for JavaScript errors in console
2. **Subjects Not Loading**: Verify API endpoint connectivity
3. **Search Not Working**: Ensure search input is properly connected
4. **Responsive Issues**: Check CSS media queries

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode by adding `?debug=true` to the URL to see detailed console logs.
